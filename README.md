# hello-world
just another repository 
Hi GitHub!
My name is Luan Nguyen. I have started to study programing for a day. I want to become a software developer in the future.
This is second year I live in the U.S. Software developer is high demand job in the next years. I will try my best to finish this course so that I can earn a good job in the future.
Thanks
